    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>A bamboo sushi mat, these are inexpensive and easy to find.</li>
    <li>Nori sheets, these are sheets of seaweed for making sushi and can be found in most supermarkets.</li>
    <li>Sushi seasoning (vinegar), you can make this at home and it's fairly easy to do. But for a beginner's guide to making sushi, let's keep it simple and use store bought sushi seasoning / vinegar.</li>
    <li>Rice, you can buy sushi rice but you can use medium grain rice which is normally cheaper and easier to find.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>1 cup of your rice, rinse well in cold water.</li>
    <li>rice needs to be cooked 1 part rice to 1.5 part water. So place the cup of rice in a pot and add 1.5 cups of water, add the lid and bring to the boil.</li>
    <li>Once its boiling reduce to simmer for around 8-10 minutes but keep an eye on it. You want the rice to absorb all the water but not burn or stick to the bottom on the pot!</li>
    <li>Once the rice is cooked, cool it quickly by spreading it out on a tray, add 2 to 3 tablespoons of the sushi seasoning and mix well. Taste and adjust to your preference.</li>
